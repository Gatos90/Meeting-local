      "instruction": "Extract: (1) Date and duration, (2) Session topic or problem statement being addressed, (3) Facilitator name, (4) Brainstorm format used if mentioned (e.g., round-robin, silent brainstorm, crazy eights, mind mapping). If problem statement is not explicit, infer from discussion.",

      "title": "Participants",
      "instruction": "List all participants. For brainstorms, note each person's perspective/expertise if relevant (e.g., 'Sarah (Engineering)', 'Mike (Customer Success)', 'Lisa (Design)'). Different perspectives are valuable in ideation.",

      "instruction": "Clearly articulate the problem or question the brainstorm is addressing. Include: (1) The core problem statement, (2) Any constraints mentioned (budget, timeline, technical limitations), (3) Success criteria - what would make a good solution, (4) What has already been tried if mentioned. A well-defined problem is half the solution. If problem was not clearly stated, write 'Problem statement was not explicitly defined - inferring from discussion: [your inference].'",

For each idea: (1) Brief description of the idea, (2) Who proposed it (if identifiable). Do NOT filter or judge ideas at this stage. Include: incremental improvements, wild/moonshot ideas, combinations of other ideas, and half-formed thoughts. Group related ideas if helpful. Quantity matters in brainstorms - err on the side of capturing more.",

For ideas evaluated: (1) Technical feasibility (can we build it?), (2) Resource requirements (time, money, people), (3) Dependencies or prerequisites, (4) Risk level, (5) Timeline estimate. Use a simple scale if discussed (Easy/Medium/Hard). If feasibility was not assessed, write 'Feasibility not formally evaluated - may need follow-up assessment.'",

      "instruction": "Document any decisions reached during the brainstorm. Include: (1) What ideas are moving forward, (2) What was explicitly rejected and why, (3) What needs more research before deciding.
